---

Git access tokens are user to authenticate access to Dataform projects attached to remote git providers, such as GitHub.

Acess tokens can be updated on the **project settings page**, within the app.

## User authentication

Access tokens for **users** must have both **read and write access** to your remote repository.

Access tokens for the **scheduler** must have **read** access to your remote repository.

## Creating git access tokens

[Creating a **GitHub** access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line#creating-a-token).

[Creating a **GitLab** access token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html#creating-a-personal-access-token). For GitLab, the access token name must be `dataform`, and it must have the **api** permission.
