## Introduction

Schedules can be used to run any selection of your datasets at a user-specified frequency. Running your scripts on a repeating schedule ensures output data is always kept up to date.

  . Make sure you commit and push your changes to the production branch after configuring schedules.

## Scheduler access tokens

For projects using a remote git project (e.g. hosted on GitHub), a scheduler access token is required. [More info on configuring git access tokens](./git-access-tokens).
