## GitHub & GitLab integration

Dataform Web projects can be connected directly to your own Git provider, meaning you stay in control of your code and can continue to use the CLI.

## Data catalog

Dataform Web has a built in data catalog that is automatically generated from your Dataform project and can be shared with the rest of your team.
