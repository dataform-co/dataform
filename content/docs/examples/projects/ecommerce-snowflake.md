## Summary

This project transforms four raw datasets (`CUSTOMER`, `NATION`, `LINEITEM` and `ORDERS`) into three summary reporting tables.

- `CUSTOMER_STATS` provides a single view of all customers: how many orders they’ve made, how much they’ve spent, where they’re from.
- `ORDER_STATS` provides a single view of every order, adding the number of line-items it included.
- `DAILY_COUNTRY_STATS` provides an aggregate view of total daily order volumes by country.
