## Comitting changes

Dataform uses the Git version control system to maintain a record of each change made to project files and to manage file versions. Each Dataform project has an associated Git repository.

When you first use Dataform we will automatically create a personal development branch for you called `name_dev`. Only you can see this branch and commit to it. All the changes you've made so far should be on this branch.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 55.93750000000001%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/7e0f28b3ff8d473f9594019a7b0bff70" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

1. Press the `Comitt Changes` button:

   - In the modal you should see a list of all the changes you made to your project.

2. Give your commits a description and press `Commit`.

3. Click the `Push to Master` button to push your changes to the master branch:

   - The changes will now be on `production` and used for future schedule runs.

For more information on how version control works in Dataform, see our [docs](https://docs.dataform.co/dataform-web/version-control).

## Summary

Youâ€™ve now created your two tables; `order stats` and `customers`. `customers` depends on `order_stats` and will not be run until `order_stats` is updated. You have added data quality tests so that you know the data is reliable and you have documented your datasets so other team members know what the tables contain. A schedule will run every hour to keep the tables up to date, and you will be automatically alerted if the pipeline fails or there are data quality issues.
