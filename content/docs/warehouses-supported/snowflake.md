# Authentification

Snowflake connections require the following elements:

- Account name: the first part of your Snowflake url, including region: `account-name.region`.snowflakecomputing.com
- Username and password used for your Snowflake console. You may prefer to create a separate username and password for Dataform to use - please contact our team if you need help.
- Warehouse name: Click "Warehouses" from within your Snowflake console to view a list of warehouses. Any warehouse in your account will work with any database.
- Database: Click "Databases" from within your Snowflake console to view a list of databases.

You may also need to whitelist Dataform's IP addresses: `35.233.106.210` and `104.196.10.242`

# Configuration options

## Querying different databases

You can read from and publish to an unlimited number of snowflake databases within a single Dataform project. For example, you may have a database called `RAW_SOURCE` that contains raw data loaded in your warehouse and a database called `ANALYTICS` in which you create data tables you use for analytics and reporting.

You can define a default database in your `dataform.json` file.

```js
{
    "warehouse": "snowflake",
    "defaultSchema": "dataform",
    "assertionSchema": "dataform_assertions",
    "defaultDatabase": "ANALYTICS"
}

```

You can then override the default database in the config block of your SQLX files.

```js
config {
    type: "table",
    database: “RAW_SOURCE”
}

```

### Using separate databases for development and production

You can configure separate databases for development and production in your `environment.json` file. The process is described on [this page](https://docs.dataform.co/dataform-web/guides/environments#example-use-separate-databases-for-development-and-production-data).

# Dataform web features

## Real time query validation

Dataform validates the compiled script you are editing against Snowflake in real time. It will let you know if the query is valid (or won’t run) before having to run it.
