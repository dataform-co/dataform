## Authentification

Postgres projects require the following configuration settings:

- Hostname. This would be in the form `[name].[id].[region].redshift.amazonaws.com` if you are using AWS.
- Port (usually `5432`)
- Username and password
- Database name

<div className="bp3-callout bp3-icon-info-sign bp3-intent-warning" markdown="1">
  Dataform's IP addresses must be whitelisted in order to access your Postgres instance. Dataform's IP addresses are <code>35.233.106.210</code> and <code>104.196.10.242</code>.

## Dataform web features for Postgres

### Real time query validation

Dataform validates the compiled script you are editing against Postgres in real time. It will let you know if the query is valid (or wonâ€™t run) before having to run it.
