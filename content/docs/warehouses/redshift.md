## Authentification

Redshift projects require the following configuration settings:

- Hostname in the form `[name].[id].[region].redshift.amazonaws.com`
- Port (usually `5439`)
- Username and password
- Database name

<div className="bp3-callout bp3-icon-info-sign bp3-intent-warning" markdown="1">
  Dataform's IP addresses must be whitelisted in order to access your Redshift cluster. Please
  follow

    rel="noopener"
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/gsg/rs-gsg-authorize-cluster-access.html"
  >these instructions</a>. Dataform's IP addresses are <code>35.233.106.210</code> and <code>104.196.10.242</code>.
</div>

#### How to find Redshift credentials

1. Go to `Redshift` in your AWS console.
2. Select your cluster under `Clusters`.
3. The hostname is the endpoint listed at the top of the page. Username and database name are listed under cluster database properties.

The Redshift user should have permissions to `CREATE` schemas and `SELECT` from `INFORMATION_SCHEMAS.TABLES` and `INFORMATION_SCHEMAS.COLUMNS` . Please contact our team [via slack](https://join.slack.com/t/dataform-users/shared_invite/zt-dark6b7k-r5~12LjYL1a17Vgma2ru2A) if you need help.

## Configuration options

Redshift specific options can be applied to tables using the `redshift` configuration parameter.

### Distributing data

You can configure how Redshift <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/t_Distributing_data.html#t_data_distribution_concepts">distributes data</a> in your cluster by configuring the `distStyle` and `distKey` properties.

```js
config {
  type: "table",
  redshift: {
    distKey: "user_id",
    distStyle: "key"
  }
}
SELECT user_id FROM ...
```

This query compiles to the following statement:

```js
CREATE TABLE "dataform"."example"
DISTKEY(user_id)
DISTSTYLE even
AS SELECT user_id FROM ...
```

### Sorting data

You can also configure how Redshift <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/t_Sorting_data.html">sorts data</a> in your datasets with the `sortKeys` and `sortStyle` properties.

```js
config {
  redshift: {
    sortKeys: [ "ts" ],
    sortStyle: "compound"
  }
}
SELECT 1 AS ts
```

### Binding views

By default, all views in Redshift are created as late binding views. This can be changed by setting the `bind` property in the redshift configuration block.

```js
config {
  type: "view",
  redshift: {
    bind: true
  }
}
SELECT 1 AS ts
```

## Dataform web features for Redshift

### Real time query validation

Dataform validates the compiled script you are editing against Redshift in real time. It will let you know if the query is valid (or wonâ€™t run) before having to run it.

## Sample Dataform project with Redshift

We prepared the following sample project of a fictional ecommerce store using using Redshift.
