## Introduction

A Dataform project is primarily configured through the `dataform.json` file that is created at the top level of your project directory.

Since Dataform projects use NPM for package management, you can also control dependencies and the current Dataform version through the `package.json` file.

## `dataform.json`

This file contains information about the project. These settings, such as the warehouse type, default schema names, and so on, are used to compile SQL.

The following is an example of the `dataform.json` file for a BigQuery project:

```json
{
  "warehouse": "bigquery",
  "defaultSchema": "dataform",
  "assertionsSchema": "dataform_assertions",
  "gcloudProjectId": "my-project-id"
}
```

See the [`dataform.json` reference](/reference/dataform-json) for more information on all configurable settings.

### Changing default schema names

Dataform aims to create all objects under a single schema (or dataset in BigQuery) in your warehouse. This is usually called `dataform` but can be changed
by changing the `defaultSchema` property to some other value. For example, to change it to `mytables`, update the configuration file as following:

```json
{
  ...
  "defaultSchema": "mytables",
  ...
}
```

[Assertions](/guides/assertions) are created inside a different schema as specified by the `assertionsSchema` property. This is similarly configurable.

## `package.json`

This is a standard NPM package file which may be used to include JavaScript packages within your project.

Most importantly, your Dataform version is specified here, and can be updated by changing this file or running the `npm install` or `npm update` commands inside your project directory.

If you develop projects on https://dataform.co, this is managed for you and can be largely ignored.

### Updating Dataform to the latest version

All Dataform projects depend on the NPM package `@dataform/core`. If you are developing your project locally and would like to upgrade your Dataform version, you can run the following command:

```bash
npm update @dataform/core
```

If you run `dataform` commands, you may also wish to upgrade your globally installed Dataform version:

```bash
npm update -g @dataform/cli
```
