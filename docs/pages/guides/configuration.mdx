## Introduction

A dataform project is primarily configured through the `dataform.json` file that is created at the top level of your project directory.

As Dataform projects use NPM for package management, you can also control dependencies and the current dataform version through the `package.json` file. 

## `dataform.json`

Stores information about the project that is used to compile SQL, such as the warehouse type, default schemas, and warehouse specific settings.

The following is an example of the `dataform.json` file for a default BigQuery project:
```json
{
  "warehouse": "bigquery",
  "defaultSchema": "dataform",
  "assertionsSchema": "dataform_assertions",
  "gcloudProjectId": "my-project-id"
}
```

See the [`dataform.json` reference](/reference/dataform-json) for more information on all the settings that can be configured.

## Changing default schemas

Dataform aims to create all objects under a single schema (or dataset in BigQuery) in your warehouse. This is usually called `dataform` but can be changed by editing the `defaultSchema` property to something else. For example to change it to `mytables` update the configuration file as such:

```json
{
  ...
  "defaultSchema": "mytables",
  ...
}
```

[Assertions](/guides/assertions) are created in a different schema as denoted by the `assertionsSchema` property. This can also be changed similar to above.


## `package.json`

This is a regular Node/NPM package file which can be used it include JavaScript packages within your project.

Most importantly, your Dataform version is logged here, and can be updated by changing this file or running the `npm install` or `npm update` commands inside your project directory.

This is managed for you when developing projects on https://dataform.co and so can be largely ignored.

## Updating dataform to the latest version

All dataform projects depend on the package `@dataform/core`. To upgrade your dataform version, you can run the following command when developing locally:

```bash
npm update @dataform/core
```

When running commands such as `dataform run`, you may need to also upgrade your globally installed dataform version. This can be done with the command:

```bash
npm update -g @dataform/cli
```
