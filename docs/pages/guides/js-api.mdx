## Introduction

Dataform provides a JavaScript API for defining all actions via code, rather than through creating individual SQL files. This can be useful in advanced use cases.

To use the JavaScript API, create a `.js` file anywhere in the `definitions/` folder of your project. This code will be run during project compilation.

The JavaScript API provides methods that create any of the actions that you would otherwise define in a SQL file:
- Publish a table
- Define custom SQL operations
- Write tests against data

These are regular JavaScript (ES5) files that can contain arbitrary code, for loops, functions, constants etc.

## Defining actions via JavaScript

The following file shows a simple example of creating the 3 primary actions via JavaScript:

`definitions/example.js`:
```js
publish("table1")
  .query("select 1 as test");

assert("assertion1")
  .query("select * from source_table where value is null");

operate("operation1")
  .query("insert into some_table (test) values (2)");
```

This creates a table, an assertion, and an operation in a single file, which would have otherwise required 3 seperate files to be created.

## Setting properties on actions

Each of the global methods, `publish()`, `operate()`, `assert()` returns an object that can then be used to configure that action. The API follows a builder syntax which can be seen in the following example:

```js
publish("table1")
  .query("select 1 as test")    // Defines the main query
  .type("table")                // Set's the type of the table
  .dependecies(["other_table"]) // Add's dependencies
  .descriptor({
    "test": "Value is 1"        // Describes fields in the table
  });
```

Multiple properties can also be set using the `config()` method, or as a shorthand, passed as a second argument to the method:

```js
publish("table1", {
  query: "select 1 as test",
  type: "table",
  dependecies: ["other_table"],
  descriptor: {
    "test": "Value is 1"
  }
});
```

To see all the settings that can be configured for each action type, refer to the relevant reference below:

- [`publish()`](/reference/materializations)
- [`operate()`](/reference/operations)
- [`assert()`](/reference/assertions)

## Using built-in functions such as `ref()`

When writing `.sql` files, Dataform makes a number of built in functions such as `ref()` and `self()` available to use within the main query. For example the file `definitions/example.sql`:
```js
select * from ${ref("other_table")}
```

The `ref()` function is made available automatically. This is not the case when using the JavaScript API.

To use these functions, certain methods such as `query()` accept a contextable argument. Instead of providing a string as the argument, a function can be provided that will be passed a `context` object which has all these methods available on it.

To mirror the behaviour above, you can use a contextable argument to the `query()` method and take advantage of JavaScript template strings:

`definitions/example.js`:
```js
publish("example")
  .query(ctx => `select ${ctx.ref("other_table")}`);
```
<div class="bp3-callout bp3-icon-info-sign bp3-intent-warning" markdown="1">
In order to use the <code>${"{}"}</code> syntax to call methods inline in a string, the argument must be wrapped in backticks<code>`</code> instead of regular quotes <code>"</code>.
</div>

<br/>

The following methods and configuration options accept a contextable argument and be called in a similar way:
- `query()`
- `where()`
- `preOps()`
- `postOps()`

Contextable arguments can also be provided via the `config()` API, again mirroring the behaviour above:

```js
publish("example")
  .config({
    query: ctx => `select ${ctx.ref("other_table")}`
  });
```

## Creating several tables at once

One of the most common use cases for using the JavaScript API is to perform a similar action several times.

For example, imagine you have several tables, all of which have a field `user_id`. You would like to create a view of each table with certain blacklisted user IDs removed. You can perform this across all tables using a JavaScript `forEach` statement:

`definitions/blacklist_views.js`:
```js
const tableNames = [
  "user_events",
  "user_settings",
  "user_logs"
  "user_friends"
];

tableNames.forEach(tableName => {
  publish(tableName + "_blacklist_removed")
    .query(ctx => `
      select * from ${ref(tableName)}
      where user_id not in (
        select user_id
        from ${ref("blacklisted_user_ids")}
      )`);
});
```

This would create 4 new views, `user_events_blacklist_removed`, etc, that don't contain any of the users with blacklisted IDs.
