## Introduction

Dataform provides a JavaScript API for defining all actions via code rather than through creating individual SQL files. This can be useful in advanced use cases.

To use the JavaScript API, create a `.js` file anywhere in the `definitions/` folder of your project. This code will be run during project compilation.

The JavaScript API provides methods that create any of the actions that you would otherwise define in a SQL file:

- Tables
- Assertions
- Operations

These are regular JavaScript (ES5) files that can contain arbitrary code, for loops, functions, constants, etc.

## Defining actions in JavaScript

The following file is a simple example of creating actions in JavaScript:

`definitions/example.js`:

```js
publish("table1").query("SELECT 1 AS test");

assert("assertion1").query("SELECT * FROM source_table WHERE value IS NULL");

operate("operation1").query("INSERT INTO some_table (test) VALUES (2)");
```

This example creates a table, an assertion, and an operation in a single file, which if written in SQL would have required 3 seperate files.

## Setting properties on actions

Each of the global methods, `publish()`, `operate()`, `assert()` returns an object that can then be used to configure that action. The API follows a builder syntax which can be seen in the following example:

```js
publish("table1")
  .query("SELECT 1 AS test") // Defines the query
  .type("table") // Sets the type of the table
  .dependencies(["other_table"]) // Specifies table dependencies
  .descriptor({
    test: "Value is 1" // Describes fields in the table
  });
```

Multiple properties can also be set using the `config()` method, or as a shorthand, passed as a second argument to the method:

```js
publish("table1", {
  query: "SELECT 1 AS test",
  type: "table",
  dependencies: ["other_table"],
  descriptor: {
    test: "Value is 1"
  }
});
```

Configuration options for each type of action are listed at the relevant reference documentation:

- [`publish()`](/reference/tables)
- [`operate()`](/reference/operations)
- [`assert()`](/reference/assertions)

## Using built-in functions such as `ref()`

When writing `.sql` files, Dataform makes a number of built in functions such as `ref()` and `self()` available to use within the main query. For example in a `definitions/example.sql` file:

```js
SELECT * FROM ${ref("other_table")}
```

The `ref()` function is made available for the script to use automatically. Note that this is not the case when using the JavaScript API.

To use these functions in JavaScript, API methods - such as `query()` - take a `Contextable` argument. Instead of providing a string as the argument to the API method,
you can pass a function whose only parameter is a `context` object. This object makes the built in functions available for use.

For example, to mirror the above example using JavaScript (also making handy use of JavaScript template strings):

`definitions/example.js`:

```js
publish("example").query(ctx => `SELECT * FROM ${ctx.ref("other_table")}`);
```

<div className="pt-callout pt-icon-info-sign pt-intent-warning" markdown="1">
  Note that JavaScript template strings - which allow use of the <code>${"{}"}</code> syntax
  directly inside strings - the string in question must be wrapped in backticks (<code>`</code>)
  instead of single (<code>'</code>) or double (<code>"</code>) quotes.
</div>

<br />

The following methods and configuration options accept a function taking a `Contextable` argument as in the above example:

- `query()`
- `where()`
- `preOps()`
- `postOps()`

`Contextable` arguments can also be provided via the `config()` API:

```js
publish("example").config({
  query: ctx => `SELECT * FROM ${ctx.ref("other_table")}`
});
```

## Creating several tables at once

One of the most common use cases for using the JavaScript API is to perform a similar action several times.

For example, imagine you have several tables, all of which have a field `user_id`. You would like to create a view of each table with certain blacklisted user IDs removed.
You could perform this action across all tables using a JavaScript `forEach` statement:

`definitions/blacklist_views.js`:

```js
const tableNames = ["user_events", "user_settings", "user_logs", "user_friends"];

tableNames.forEach(tableName => {
  publish(tableName + "_blacklist_removed").query(
    ctx => `
      SELECT * FROM ${ctx.ref(tableName)}
      WHERE user_id NOT IN (
        SELECT user_id
        FROM ${ctx.ref("blacklisted_user_ids")}
      )`
  );
});
```

This script would create 4 new views named `user_events_blacklist_removed` (and so on) that don't contain any of the users with blacklisted IDs.
