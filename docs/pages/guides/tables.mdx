## Create a view

Create a new file in your project under the `definitions/` folder, such as `definitions/example.sql`:

```js
select 1 as test
```

This will create a `view` by default, that will be called `example` in the dataform schema defined in the [`dataform.json`](/guides/configuration#dataform.json) file.

<div className="bp3-callout bp3-icon-info-sign bp3-intent-warning" markdown="1">
Trailing semi-colons should be omitted at the end of the query.
</div>

## Create a table

By default, tables are actually created as `views` in your warehouse. To create a copy of the query result as an actual table from the query, you can use Dataform's JavaScript configuration syntax to set the `type` of the query to `table`.

```js
--js type("table");
select 1 as test
```

Configuration statements starting with `--js` will be stripped from the compiled query, leaving the actual final query to be executed as:

```js
select 1 as test
```

## Referencing other tables

Dataform provides methods that enable you to easily reference another table in your project, without having to provide the full SQL table name.


`definitions/source.sql`:
```js
select 1 as sourcedata
```

`definitions/example.sql`:
```js
select * from ${ref("source")}
```

The value we provide to the `ref()` function is the name of the file that defines the table you would like to reference, *without* the extension. In this case, as the source table is defined in the file `source.sql`, we use the string value `"source"`.

The query will be compiled into the following SQL before it is run:

```js
select * from "dataform_schema"."source"
```

Any table that is referenced in a query will be automatically added to it's dependencies. When the queries are executed against the warehouse, this makes sure they are done so in the correct order.

<div className="bp3-callout bp3-icon-info-sign bp3-intent-warning" markdown="1">
File names must be unique within your <code>definitions/</code> folder, even across directories, as these determine the name of the table or view created within your warehouse.
</div>

## Adding custom dependencies

You may want to make sure a table is created only after another table is created, but without explicitly referencing it in the query itself. For this, you can use another JavaScript configuration method called `dependencies(...)`:

```js
--js dependencies("some_table");
select * from ...
```

Multiple dependencies can also be provided in a single call:

```js
--js dependencies(["some_table", "some_other_table"]);
select * from ...
```

## Disable a table

To stop a table being created, you can call the `disabled()` method. This will keep the table as part of your graph, but stop it from executing when you run your project. This is useful if the query breaks, and you don't want your entire pipeline to fail while it's fixed.

```js
--js disabled();
select * from ...
```

## Executing statements before or after creating tables

To execute one or more SQL statements before or after creating a table, you can use the `preOps()` and `postOps()` configuration methods.

### Granting table access with `postOps()`

The following example SQL file defines a post operation to grant access to the table to specific groups, after the table is created. It makes use of the `self()` method, that returns a fully qualified table name of the current table.

```js
--js postOps(`grant select on ${self()} to group "allusers@dataform.co"`);
select * from ...
```

<div className="bp3-callout bp3-icon-info-sign bp3-intent-warning" markdown="1">
To use the <code>self()</code> method within the argument provided to <code>postOps</code>, you must use JavaScript's ES6 template string syntax, wrapping it in back-ticks <code>`</code>.
</div>

<br/>

Multiple arguments can be provided to `postOps` and `preOps`, each a seperate query, which will be executed in the order given. You can also use the multi-line configuration statement (below) to make this cleaner:

```js
/*js
```

<div style={{ marginTop: "-30px" }} />

```js
postOps([
  `grant select on ${self()} to group "allusers@dataform.co"`,
  `grant select on ${self()} to group "otherusers@dataform.co"`,
]);
```

<div style={{ marginTop: "-30px" }} />

```js
*/
```

## Overriding the output schema

By default, all tables are created within the default schema chosen when initializing a project, usually `dataform`.

This can be overriden by changing the file name to have a fully qualified table name. For example, to create a table called `example` in the schema `other_schema`, create a file with the name `definitions/other_schema.example.sql`:

```js
select 1 as test
```

This will override the output schema of the table to `other_schema`. To reference such tables, use the fully qualified name of the table, for example:

```js
select * from ${ref("other_schema.table")}
```


## Configuration statements

There are a few equivelant ways of using JS configuration statements covered below.

### Single line statements

Each line starting with `--js` will be interpreted as JavaScript.

```js
--js type("table");
--js disabled(true);
```

### Multi-line statements

For writing JavaScript over multiple lines, create a comment block that starts with `/*js` and ends with `*/`:

```js
/*js
```

<div style={{ marginTop: "-30px" }} />

```js
type("table");
disabled(true);
```

<div style={{ marginTop: "-30px" }} />

```js
*/
```

### Setting multiple properties with `config()`

Most settings for a table can be set in a single call to the `config(...)` method, and are passed in via a JSON object:


```js
/*js
```

<div style={{ marginTop: "-30px" }} />

```js
config({
  type: "table",
  disabled: true,
});
```

<div style={{ marginTop: "-30px" }} />

```js
*/
```
