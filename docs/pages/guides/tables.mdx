## Create a view

Create a new `example.sql` file in your project under the `definitions/` folder:

```js
SELECT 1 AS TEST
```

By default, upon running this query, a **view** called `schema.example` will be created (where `schema` is the Dataform schema defined in your [`dataform.json`](/guides/configuration#dataform.json) file).

<div className="pt-callout pt-icon-info-sign pt-intent-warning" markdown="1">
  Trailing semi-colons should be omitted from queries.
</div>

<div className="pt-callout pt-icon-info-sign pt-intent-warning" markdown="1">
  File names must be unique within your <code>definitions/</code> folder, even across different
  directories, because these determine the name of the table or view created within your warehouse.
</div>

## Create a table

By default, tables are actually created as views in your warehouse. To create an actual table, i.e. a full independent copy of the query result, you can use Dataform's JavaScript configuration syntax to set the `type` of the query to `table`.

```js
--js type("table");
SELECT 1 AS TEST
```

Note that configuration statements starting with `--js` are stripped during query compilation, so the final executable query in this case would be:

```js
SELECT 1 AS TEST
```

## Referencing other tables

Dataform provides methods that enable you to easily reference another table in your project without having to provide the full SQL table name.

`definitions/source.sql`:

```js
SELECT 1 AS sourcedata
```

`definitions/ref_example.sql`:

```js
SELECT * FROM ${ref("source")}
```

In order to reference the table created by a `source.sql` file, the value that should be passed to the `ref()` function is `"source"`, i.e. the name of the file defining the table (_without_ the file extension).

The query will be compiled into the following SQL before it is run:

```js
SELECT * FROM "dataform_schema"."source"
```

Any table that is referenced by a query will automatically be added to that query's dependencies. Dependency queries are always executed before dependent queries to ensure pipeline correctness.

## Adding custom dependencies

If you want to manually add a dependency to a query - one that is not already explicitly referenced with `ref()` - you can use the `dependencies()` JavaScript configuration method:

```js
--js dependencies("some_table");
SELECT * FROM ...
```

Multiple dependencies may be provided in a single invocation:

```js
--js dependencies(["some_table", "some_other_table"]);
SELECT * FROM ...
```

## Disable a table

To stop a query being run, you can use the JavaScript `disabled()` method. This will keep the table as part of your graph, but stop it from executing when you run your project.
This can be useful for example if the relevant query breaks for some reason and you don't want your pipeline to fail while it's being fixed.

```js
--js disabled();
SELECT * FROM ...
```

## Executing statements before or after table creation

To execute one or more SQL statements before or after creating a table, you can use the `preOps()` and `postOps()` configuration methods.

### Example: Granting table access with `postOps()`

The following example defines a post-query operation to configure table access permissions. It makes use of the built-in `self()` method which returns the fully-qualified name of the current table.

```js
--js postOps(`GRANT SELECT ON ${self()} TO GROUP "allusers@dataform.co"`);
SELECT * FROM ...
```

<div className="pt-callout pt-icon-info-sign pt-intent-warning" markdown="1">
  To use the <code>self()</code> method within the string argument provided to{" "}
  <code>postOps()</code>, you must use JavaScript's ES6 template string syntax, wrapping the string
  in back-ticks: <code>`template_string`</code>
</div>

<br />

Multiple arguments can be provided to `postOps()` and `preOps()`, each a seperate query, which will be executed in the provided order. You can alternatively use a multi-line configuration statement:

```js
/*js
```

<div style={{ marginTop: "-40px" }} />

```js
postOps([
  `GRANT SELECT ON ${self()} TO GROUP "allusers@dataform.co"`,
  `GRANT SELECT ON ${self()} TO GROUP "otherusers@dataform.co"`
]);
```

<div style={{ marginTop: "-40px" }} />

```js
*/
```

## Overriding the output schema

By default, all tables are created within the default schema chosen when initializing a project, usually `dataform`.

This can be overridden on a per-file basis by changing the file name to have a fully qualified table name.
For example, to create a table called `example` in the schema `other_schema`, create a file with the name `definitions/other_schema.example.sql`.
This will override the output schema of the table to `other_schema`. To reference tables with overridden schemas, use the fully qualified name of the table:

```js
SELECT * FROM ${ref("other_schema.table")}
```

## Configuration statements

Each of the following examples of JavaScript configuration statements results in equivalent behavior.

### Single line statements

Every line starting with `--js` will be interpreted as JavaScript.

```js
--js type("table");
--js disabled(true);
```

### Multi-line statements

To write JavaScript over multiple lines, create a comment block that starts with `/*js` and ends with `*/`:

```js
/*js
```

<div style={{ marginTop: "-40px" }} />

```js
type("table");
disabled(true);
```

<div style={{ marginTop: "-40px" }} />

```js
*/
```

### Setting multiple properties with `config()`

Most settings for a table can be passed in a single JSON object using the `config()` method:

```js
/*js
```

<div style={{ marginTop: "-40px" }} />

```js
config({
  type: "table",
  disabled: true
});
```

<div style={{ marginTop: "-40px" }} />

```js
*/
```
