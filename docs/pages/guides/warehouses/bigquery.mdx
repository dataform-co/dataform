BigQuery specific options can be applied to tables using the `bigquery()` configuration statement.

## Setting table partitions

BigQuery supports [table partitions](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/partitioned-tables), and these can be configured with the `partitionBy` option.

```js
--js type("table");
--js bigquery({ partitionBy: "date(ts)" });
select current_timestamp() as ts
```

This is useful when you have data spread across many different dates, and often query the produced table on only a small range of dates. This will increase query performance and reduce cost.

The above query will end up executing a statement like so when the graph is run. This takes advantage of BigQuery's DDL to set the partitioning:

```js
create or replace table dataform.example
partition by date(ts)
as (select current_timestamp() as ts)
```
