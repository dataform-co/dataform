BigQuery specific options can be applied to tables using the `bigquery()` configuration statement.

## Setting table partitions

BigQuery supports <a target="_blank" href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/partitioned-tables">partitioned tables</a>.
These can be useful when you have data spread across many different dates but usually query the table on only a small range of dates.
In these circumstances, partitioning will increase query performance and reduce cost.

BigQuery partitions can be configured in Dataform using the `partitionBy` option:

```js
--js type("table");
--js bigquery({ partitionBy: "DATE(ts)" });
SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() AS ts
```

This query compiles to the following statement, taking advantage of BigQuery's DDL to configure partitioning:

```js
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE dataform.example
PARTITION BY DATE(ts)
AS (SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() AS ts)
```
