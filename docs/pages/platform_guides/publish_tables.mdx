## Create a new file

Create a new file by clicking on the + button next to the `definitions` folder and create a new SQL file named `onboarding_table`.
For now, ignore the other options (Assertions, Operations, JavaScript); these are more advanced features which will be covered in later documentation.

## Write a query

In the text editor, write a simple SQL statement:

```js
SELECT 1 AS one,
       2 AS two,
       3 AS three
```

You will see the right sidebar update with `onboarding_table` which is the name of the table, a tag for the type - a view by default - as well as a validation message and two action buttons.

The `Execute query` button executes the query in your warehouse and returns the output at the bottom of the page. This can be useful during query development to check that the query returns expected output.

## Run the query

Clicking the `Run this node` button will open a dialog box with a few options for running your nodes. Click `Run now` to continue.

Upon successful completion of the run, a new view named `dataform.onboarding_table` will be created in your warehouse.

<div className="pt-callout pt-icon-info-sign pt-intent-primary" markdown="1">
  By default, Dataform creates tables and views under a schema named <code>dataform</code>. You can
  change this in the <code>dataform.json</code> in your{" "}
  <a href="../guides/configuration">project configuration</a>.
</div>

## Create a table instead of a view

By default, Dataform creates views in your data warehouse. To create a table instead, add the following statement at the top of your script:

```js
--js type("table");
```

You will see the tag on the right sidebar update from `view` to `table`.

<div className="pt-callout pt-icon-info-sign pt-intent-none" markdown="1">
  Dataform provides many other options for table creation. Learn about{" "}
  <a href="../guides/tables">publishing tables</a> and{" "}
  <a href="../guides/incremental-tables">incremental tables</a>.
</div>

</ScreenshotWrapper>

## Referencing other tables

Dataform provides methods that enable you to easily reference another table in your project using the `ref()` function:

```js
SELECT * FROM ${ref('my_table')}
```

This provides two advantages:

- You donâ€™t have provide the full SQL table name.
- Any table that is referenced by a query will be automatically added to that query's dependencies. Dependency queries are always executed before dependent queries to ensure correctness.

## Create a new file

Create a new SQL file named `onboarding_table2` and add the following content:

```js
SELECT * FROM ${ref('onboarding_table')}
```

<ScreenshotWrapper>
<img
  src="/static/images/platform_guides/publish_tables/ref_query.png"
  style={{ width: "100%" }}
/>
</ScreenshotWrapper>

You will see the right sidebar update with the name of the view, `onboarding_table2`. Clicking on `Show compiled` will display the fully qualified query to be run in your data warehouse.
The `${ref()}` function will be replaced with the actual name of the table in your data warehouse. Note that the dependency is also listed just above the query validation message.

_*Your compiled script will differ depending on your cloud data warehouse. This example uses Redshift.*_

<div className="pt-callout pt-icon-info-sign pt-intent-warning" markdown="1">
  Referencing a table that hasn't yet been created in your data warehouse will cause validation
  errors. These validation errors are warning you that the table you are referencing doesn't exist
  (yet). However, since Dataform will run your project's scripts in dependency order, you can safely
  ignore these errors.
</div>

## View dependency tree

The overview page (linked at the top left of Dataform) gives you an overview of your project. The overview includes a visualization of the dependency tree of your project, containing the two tables created by your scripts.

In bigger projects containing dozens or hundreds of tables with complicated interdependencies, the overview page can help you keep track of your project's overall structure.
