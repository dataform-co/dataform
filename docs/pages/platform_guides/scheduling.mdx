## Introduction

Schedules can be used to run any selection of your datasets on a schedule with granular control. That will make sure your data is up to date in your reports and dashboards or for other analysts to use.

## View past runs

You can find the current and historical schedules runs under your project’s *Run logs* page on the left menu bar.
