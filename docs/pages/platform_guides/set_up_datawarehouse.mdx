## Introduction

Dataform connects to your data warehouse to send the SQL instructions that will create views, tables and perform other operations you specify in Dataform.

Different cloud data warehouses require different set up. Setting up any cloud data warehouse should take 5 minutes. If you encounter any issue, please contact our team via the intercom messenger or via email at [team@dataform.co](mailto:team@dataform.co).
